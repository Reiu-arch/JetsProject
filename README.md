## Description 
In this program you are given a list of choices in which you are able to carry out a mulitude of options from flying the fighter jets, adding new planes and listing current jets in the hanger. There are three types of jets that are currently avaliable to add or remove, fighter, passanger, and cargo jets. 

## Usage 
From what is currently possible within this program you are able to add, remove, initiate a dogfight between figher jets, or load the cargo jets. There is a slightly more robust filtering system than my previous AnimalSanctuaryProject.

## Lessons Learned
From what I have learned is that it is much easier to edit, add, and manipulate data from a text file for larger quanities of data than it is creating sperate instances of each one. Though it is still a bit rough when it comes to setting up the process in which it takes to extract the information, I do find the use of storing data in text files far more convenient. Another tool I implimented was the new list array function. This listing process is far more understandable than the previous array listing process. As for what it takes to be able to filter out user input, I have learned new ways to regulate and help correct the missinputs of my users, though i feel there may be more robust methods to be able to impliment such actions.
